# pdf_utils
Simple PDF splitters and merge utilities using Python. Its simple and dumb. Use Ghostscript in the backend, hardcoded by gsw64c for windows, change if you are on Linux or other OSes as required. There are three short utility scripts using which you can:
1. Merge twp PDFs
2. Split pages from a PDF by giving a range (if you want a single PDF, both 'From' and 'To" page numbers take the same page no)
3. Delete page(s) from a PDF
